# Gobline

Gobline is a WIP command line character sheet for dnd 5e

![gobline](/imgs/gobline.png?raw=true "Main Window")

It is written in Go and leverages the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) library to make styling the UI easier.

## Usage
It is still very much a work in progress, but it can be test-driven in a go 1.16 enabled environment with a `go run main.go`
